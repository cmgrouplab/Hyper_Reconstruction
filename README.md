# Hyper_Reconstruction
Generating realization of hyperuniform materials based on partially constrained S2 and spectral density via integration of S2

 the C++ code for generating a hyperuniform realizations based on a specific S2, which was used in Xu et al. PRE paper. The key ideas include (1) adding a energy term that is related to the hyperuniformity constraint (2) constraining only a part of the full S2 function to examine the effects of short- and long-range orders on hyperuniformity. 

The attached code is specific to generate realizations based on S2 for an equilibrium hard sphere packing. The target S2 is directly computed from a digital realization of the packing "Digital.2D.N344.Rho0.3.dat"
